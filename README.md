# NYC Portal

NYC Portal is a WebVR experience to see what the city looked like a century ago, centered in three places I spend the most time in around NYC. A 360-degree photosphere grounds viewers in each location, but focuses on an interactive 3D carousel of photos. Viewers can rifle through the deck of photos, organized in a chronological timeline, and see the photos up close, with details like the year, the exact location, and captions of the photos transcribed from the archives.

Itâ€™s built with [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction), a React renderer for Three.js, [uikit](https://docs.pmnd.rs/uikit/getting-started/introduction), and [Vite](https://vite.dev).

Photos are from [OldNYC](https://www.oldnyc.org/), a project that maps historical photos from the New York Public Library to their locations in the city.
